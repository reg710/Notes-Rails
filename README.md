# Sticky Notes
Academy Pittsburgh project to use Rails to create something similar to Google Keep/Miro Boards. It allows you to create new post-it notes and remove old notes. I'd like to come back to add ability to rearrange notes on the page and change note colors.

* Ruby version - 3.0.0

## To Do
- [x] Create model, view, and controller for notes
- [x] Set up initial route
- [x] Model migration
- [x] Basic note styling (square, color, in a row)
- [x] Add form to create new notes that redirects to same page
- [x] Prevent blank notes from being saved
- [x] Add ability to delete notes
- [x] Update model to include field for color
- [x] Add basic ability to select color for new notes

## Still to Do and Remaining Project Questions
- [ ] Change existing note colors
- [ ] Make them drag/droppable 
Can this be deployed to be shared? What would that require?
What kind of testing can you create/run for this type of program


Things to look up and confirm:

* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Deployment instructions
